    <h1>My top 5 movies of all time</h1>
    <h2>(in no particular order)</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
    <p>Emotionally draining in the best way. One of Jim Carrey's best roles, in my humble opinion.</p>
    <h3>The Amazing Spiderman</h3>
    <p>I love Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker.</p>
    <h3>Dreamgirls</h3>
    <p>Every song on the soundtrack is a certified bop. Also, Beyonce.</p>
    <h3>La La Land</h3>
    <p>Another great soundtrack. The ending isn't predictable but still satisfying.</p>
    <h3>Jeepers Creepers</h3>
    <p>This movie has great cinematogrpahy, great suspense and good character development.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>That's all folks!</p>
